# 🛤️ Roadmap – SkillChain

Democratizing learning through kindness and mutual exchange. No paywalls. Just people.

I want to learn a lot of thing, but the paywall is a great barrier, the things i wanna learn is too expensive/

## ✅ Phase 1 – Profile & Skill Setup
- Web app structure (React or basic stack)
- Create user profiles with:
  - Skills you offer
  - Skills you want to learn
  - Time zone, language preference

## 🔗 Phase 2 – Skill Matching & Requests
- Browse people by tag/filter
- Request exchange (e.g., 1hr design for 1hr Python)
- SkillChain Tokens (1:1 exchange rate)

## 🔄 Phase 3 – Communication & Logs
- In-app chat or email coordination
- Basic activity log ("taught X", "learned Y")
- Review/feedback system

## 🌍 Phase 4 – Growth and Community
- Invite friends / referral links
- Leaderboard for top contributors (opt-in)
- Resource sharing board

> Learning should feel like a friendship, not a transaction. 💫
